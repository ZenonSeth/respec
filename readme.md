# ReSpec

Warning: This mod is currently in very early stages of development! Things don't work as they are supposed to (yet).

## Description

ReSpec, a portmanteau of "Relative Formspec" is a formspec library for [Luanti](https://www.luanti.org).

The main goal of the library is to provide an easy, automatic way of laying out elements.

To achieve this the library uses relative positioning, very much attempting to emulate Android's Constraint Layout, though due to fundamental differences and Luanti API constraints, not all Constraint Layout features will be implemented.

A secondary goal is to support all features (with possibly only one or two exceptions that will be superseded by this mod) of [formspecs](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/blob/master/doc/lua_api.md#formspec) past formspec version 2.

## API

The API docs can be found here: [docs/api.md]().

Examples to get you quickly started are available on the Github Wiki here: [TODO]()
