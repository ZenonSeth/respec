# Respec
This mod is currently in early stages of development. Not all features are implemented, and the API may change.

Respec, from "**Re**lative Form**spec**", is a `formspec` library for [Luanti](https://www.luanti.org).

The main goal of the library is to provide an easy, automatic way of laying out elements, as well as making some things like callback handling, easier.

Respec uses relative positioning of elements, based on [Android's Constraint Layout](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/layout/constraint-layout) - however knowledge of Android or Constraint Layout is not required at all.

A secondary goal of Respec is to support all features of [formspecs](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/blob/master/doc/lua_api.md#formspec) past formspec version 2, with a few minor and trivial exceptions.

## API

The API docs can be found under [doc/api.md](https://github.com/ZenonSeth/respec/blob/main/doc/api.md).
